#GEO DASH
GEO DASH is a fast-paced 2D runner where you control a small geometric hero racing through dangerous worlds filled with spikes, traps, platforms, and impossible jumps.
The level scrolls automatically — your timing decides everything.
Jump, dodge, and survive through handcrafted obstacle courses while collecting coins and unlocking new stages.
One mistake, and the run is over.
Only perfect timing wins.
